# Materials

When placing files here, please follow the following guidelines in order to get stuff working
correctly:

- If placing Tibia and Server files, first make a folder with the respective version, e.g:
  /data/materials/910/
  		 /910/Tibia.dat
		 ...

- If placing an OTBM file (a map) just place it in /data/materials, there's no need for a version check for it.
