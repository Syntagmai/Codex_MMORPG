## Troubleshooting

### Common Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge:** Team members consistently miss meetings
**Solution:** Review meeting necessity, timing, and format. Consider asynchronous alternatives.

**Challenge:** Meetings run over time or lack focus
**Solution:** Improve agenda preparation, facilitate more actively, time-box discussions.

**Challenge:** Blockers aren't being resolved
**Solution:** Escalate to appropriate decision-makers, allocate dedicated resources.

**Challenge:** Cross-team communication is poor
**Solution:** Establish regular touchpoints, improve documentation, clarify roles.

**Challenge:** Team morale is low
**Solution:** Focus on wins and progress, address concerns openly, adjust workload.

## Success Metrics

- **Meeting effectiveness:** Percentage of meetings that achieve their objectives
- **Blocker resolution time:** Average time to resolve impediments
- **Team satisfaction:** Regular survey scores on collaboration and communication
- **Delivery predictability:** Percentage of commitments met on time
