# BMAD Game Development Framework

## Overview

This is a specialized implementation of the Better Model-Assisted Development (BMAD) methodology, specifically adapted for MMORPG game development using the Canary server architecture. The framework provides specialized agents, workflows, and templates designed to coordinate game development teams and streamline the creation of complex game features.

## Quick Start

### 1. Activate the Orchestrator
```
Load the game-team-orchestrator.md agent to begin coordinating your game development team.
```

### 2. Choose Your Development Approach
- **Feature Development**: Use `workflow feature-development` for new game features
- **Content Creation**: Work with the content-creator agent for Lua scripting and game content
- **Bug Fixes**: Coordinate through the orchestrator for efficient bug resolution
- **Performance Optimization**: Engage the engine-developer and devops-engineer agents

### 3. Team Coordination
Use `agent [role]` to transform into specialized team roles:
- `agent game_designer` - Feature design and player experience
- `agent engine_developer` - C++ engine development and optimization
- `agent content_creator` - Lua scripting and content creation
- `agent level_designer` - World design and spatial gameplay
- `agent qa_tester` - Quality assurance and testing
- `agent devops_engineer` - Infrastructure and deployment

## Key Workflows

### Feature Development Workflow
A comprehensive 4-phase process for developing MMORPG features:

1. **Concept & Design Phase** (3-5 days)
   - Feature concept creation by Game Designer
   - Technical architecture by Engine Developer
   - Content planning by Content Creator
   - Spatial requirements by Level Designer

2. **Implementation Phase** (1-2 weeks)
   - Parallel development of engine components, content, and world integration
   - Continuous coordination and integration testing

3. **Testing & Validation Phase** (3-5 days)
   - Comprehensive testing by QA Tester
   - Balance validation and player experience testing
   - Integration testing with existing systems

4. **Deployment Phase** (1-2 days)
   - Production deployment by DevOps Engineer
   - Post-deployment monitoring and optimization

## Game Development Focus Areas

### MMORPG-Specific Systems
- **Combat Systems**: Real-time combat, spells, damage calculations
- **Social Features**: Guilds, parties, chat systems, community tools
- **Economy Systems**: Trading, crafting, resource management
- **Progression Systems**: Character advancement, skill trees, achievements
- **World Systems**: Maps, instances, events, exploration
- **PvP Systems**: Player vs player combat, territory control

### Technical Specializations
- **Canary Server Architecture**: C++ engine development, Lua integration
- **Performance Optimization**: Memory management, network optimization
- **Database Management**: MySQL optimization, data persistence
- **Content Pipeline**: Asset management, content deployment
- **Security**: Anti-cheat systems, data protection
- **Scalability**: Concurrent player management, load balancing

## Getting Started Guide

### For New Teams
