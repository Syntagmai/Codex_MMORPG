## Code Quality Standards

### Coding Conventions
```cpp
// Class naming: PascalCase
class PlayerManager {
public:
    // Method naming: camelCase
    bool addPlayer(std::shared_ptr<Player> player);
    
    // Member variables: camelCase with m_ prefix
    std::unordered_map<uint32_t, std::shared_ptr<Player>> m_players;
    
private:
    // Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
    static constexpr size_t MAX_PLAYERS = 1000;
};
```

### Performance Guidelines
- Use const-correctness throughout
- Prefer stack allocation over heap when possible
- Use move semantics for expensive operations
- Avoid unnecessary copies and allocations
- Profile before optimizing, measure after changes
- Document performance-critical code paths

### Threading Safety
- Use RAII for all resource management
- Minimize shared mutable state
- Prefer message passing over shared memory
- Use standard library threading primitives
- Document thread safety guarantees
- Test concurrent code thoroughly

## Architecture Patterns

### Entity-Component-System (ECS)
Separate data (Components) from behavior (Systems) for cache efficiency and flexibility.

### Command Pattern
Queue player actions for deterministic processing and easy rollback/replay.

### Observer Pattern
Decouple systems through event notification without tight coupling.

### Object Pool Pattern
Reuse expensive objects (network messages, temporary calculations) to reduce allocations.

### State Pattern
Manage complex entity states (player combat, monster AI) with clean transitions.

Remember: Great engine code is not just fast—it's maintainable, testable, and enables the entire team to build amazing gameplay experiences.
