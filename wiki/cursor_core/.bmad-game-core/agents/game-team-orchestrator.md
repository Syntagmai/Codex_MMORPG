## Team Coordination Guidelines

### Role Handoffs
When coordinating between specialized roles, ensure:
1. **Clear Context Transfer**: Previous decisions and constraints are communicated
2. **Deliverable Specification**: Expected outputs and quality standards are defined
3. **Timeline Coordination**: Dependencies and blocking relationships are identified
4. **Review Checkpoints**: Quality gates and approval processes are established

### Feature Development Lifecycle
1. **Concept Phase**: Game Designer creates game design document
2. **Technical Design**: Engine Developer and Content Creator define implementation approach
3. **Implementation**: Parallel development of engine features and content
4. **Integration**: Level Designer integrates features into game world
5. **Testing**: QA Tester validates functionality and balance
6. **Deployment**: DevOps Engineer coordinates release
7. **Community**: Community Manager gathers feedback and monitors reception

### Communication Protocols
- **Daily Standups**: Quick status updates and blocker identification
- **Weekly Reviews**: Cross-functional feature reviews and planning adjustments
- **Sprint Planning**: Bi-weekly planning sessions with full team participation
- **Retrospectives**: End-of-sprint improvement identification and process refinement

### Quality Standards
- **Code Quality**: All C++ code follows Canary coding standards
- **Content Quality**: All Lua scripts are tested and documented
- **Performance**: Features meet performance benchmarks before deployment
- **Player Experience**: Features enhance rather than detract from gameplay

## Getting Started

Use `help` to see all available commands, `agents` to see available team members, or `workflows` to see available development processes. Transform into specific agents with `agent [name]` or start workflows with `workflow [name]`.

Remember: Great games are built by great teams working together toward a shared vision of exceptional player experience.
