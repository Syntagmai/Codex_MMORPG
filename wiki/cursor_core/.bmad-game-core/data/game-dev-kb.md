## MMORPG Development Core Concepts

### Player Engagement Principles

#### The Four Pillars of MMORPG Design
1. **Progression**: Players must feel constant growth and advancement
2. **Social Connection**: Systems that encourage meaningful player interaction
3. **Content Variety**: Diverse activities to maintain long-term engagement
4. **Player Agency**: Meaningful choices that affect the game experience

#### Engagement Loops
- **Core Loop (30 seconds - 5 minutes)**: Basic repetitive gameplay actions
- **Meta Loop (1 hour - 1 day)**: Session goals and daily objectives
- **Macro Loop (1 week - 1 month)**: Long-term progression and major goals
- **Seasonal Loop (1-3 months)**: Content updates and seasonal events

### Game Balance Frameworks

#### Nash Equilibrium in Game Design
- **Dominant Strategies**: Avoid creating strategies that are always optimal
- **Meaningful Choice**: Ensure multiple viable approaches to challenges
- **Rock-Paper-Scissors Balance**: Cyclical strength relationships
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: All player choices should have trade-offs

#### Balance Testing Methodologies
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Use spreadsheets and simulations for initial balance
- **A/B Testing**: Test different values with live player populations
- **Player Behavior Analysis**: Monitor how players actually use systems
- **Edge Case Testing**: Identify and fix extreme optimization strategies

### Technical Architecture Patterns

#### MMORPG Server Architecture
- **Client-Server Model**: Authoritative server, client prediction
- **Zone-Based Design**: Geographical server distribution
- **Database Sharding**: Distribute data across multiple databases
- **Caching Strategies**: Redis for session data, CDN for static assets
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute players across server instances

#### Performance Optimization
- **Data-Oriented Design**: Structure data for cache efficiency
- **Object Pooling**: Reuse expensive objects to reduce allocations
- **Spatial Partitioning**: Efficiently manage large game worlds
- **Network Optimization**: Reduce bandwidth through delta compression
- **Database Optimization**: Index design and query optimization

## Canary Server Specifics

### Architecture Overview

#### Core Systems
- **Game Singleton**: Central coordination and state management
- **Dispatcher**: Event system for asynchronous task processing
- **Protocol Layer**: Network communication with game clients
- **Lua Integration**: Scripting system for content and customization
- **Database Layer**: MySQL integration for persistent data

#### Threading Model
- **Main Thread**: Game logic, player actions, world simulation
- **I/O Threads**: Database operations, file I/O, network processing
- **Worker Threads**: Parallel processing of independent tasks
- **Lua Threads**: Isolated scripting environments for content

### Development Patterns

#### Entity Management
```cpp
// Preferred pattern for entity management
class Player : public Creature {
    -- Classe: Player
    std::shared_ptr<Player> getPlayer() override { return shared_from_this(); }
    // Use smart pointers for automatic memory management
};
```

#### Event Handling
#### Nível Basic
```cpp

```

#### Nível Intermediate
```cpp
// Use the dispatcher for asynchronous operations
g_dispatcher.addEvent([=]() {
    // Event handling code
    player->updateExperience(amount);
}, "player_experience_update");
```

#### Nível Advanced
```cpp
// Use the dispatcher for asynchronous operations
g_dispatcher.addEvent([=]() {
    // Event handling code
    player->updateExperience(amount);
}, "player_experience_update");
-- Adicionar metatable para funcionalidade avançada
local mt = {
    __index = function(t, k)
        return rawget(t, k) or 'Valor não encontrado'
    end
    __call = function(t, ...)
        print('Objeto chamado com:', ...)
    end
}
setmetatable(meuObjeto, mt)
```

#### Lua Integration
```lua
-- Canary Lua API patterns
    --  Canary Lua API patterns (traduzido)
function onUse(player, item, fromPosition, target, toPosition, isHotkey)
    -- Função: onUse
    if player:getLevel() < 20 then
    -- Verificação condicional
        player:sendTextMessage(MESSAGE_INFO_DESCR, "You need level 20 to use this item.")
        return false
    end
    
    -- Item functionality
    --  Item functionality (traduzido)
    return true
end
```

## Content Creation Guidelines

### Quest Design Principles

#### Narrative Structure
- **Hook**: Immediate engagement with compelling premise
- **Rising Action**: Escalating challenges and discoveries
- **Climax**: Major decision point or challenging encounter
- **Resolution**: Satisfying conclusion with appropriate rewards

#### Player Psychology
- **Curiosity Gap**: Create questions that players want answered
- **Progress Markers**: Clear indicators of advancement
- **Social Proof**: NPCs that acknowledge player achievements
- **Autonomy**: Let players choose their approach when possible

### NPC Design Standards

#### Personality Development
- **Core Motivation**: What drives this character?
- **Speech Patterns**: Consistent voice and vocabulary
- **Background**: History that informs behavior
- **Relationships**: Connections to other NPCs and factions

#### Functional Design
- **Role Clarity**: Players should understand the NPC's purpose
- **Accessibility**: Clear interaction prompts and options
- **Consistency**: Behavior should match established personality
- **Performance**: Dialogue trees that don't impact server performance

### Item Design Framework

#### Item Categories
- **Utility Items**: Tools that enable new gameplay options
- **Progression Items**: Equipment that improves character power
- **Cosmetic Items**: Customization without gameplay impact
- **Consumables**: Temporary effects and resource management
- **Social Items**: Items that facilitate player interaction

#### Balance Considerations
- **Power Creep**: Avoid making older content obsolete
- **Acquisition Time**: Balance effort required vs. power gained
- **Trade-offs**: Powerful items should have limitations
- **Uniqueness**: Special items should feel genuinely special
